# QUALINOVA

**Tagline**: Instant verification, infinite traceability.

QualiNova is an innovative blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize quality certification management. By leveraging Stellar blockchain technology, QualiNova enables certifying companies to issue, register, and verify digital certifications securely and transparently. This solution addresses challenges such as certificate forgery, lack of traceability, and inefficient audits, making compliance with standards like ISO 9001, ISO 13485, and IATF 16949 faster, more reliable, and cost-effective.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Based Certification Generation**: Automatically generate and register digital quality certifications (e.g., ISO 9001, Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing) on the Stellar blockchain.
- **Real-Time Verification**: Stakeholders (companies, auditors, customers) can instantly verify the validity of certifications using a certification number or QR code.
- **Immutability and Security**: All certifications are stored immutably on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring data integrity and eliminating the risk of forgery.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to integrate with existing quality management and audit systems, streamlining adoption and operational efficiency.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive frontend for certifying companies to manage certifications and a robust backend for data processing and blockchain integration.
